# âœ¨ About me

Younger I've played with Amstrad, gameboy, sega, segamegadrive, nes, supernes, dreamcast, nintendo64, xbox, playstation.

Until I had computer around 2000... I was around p2p, torrent and PC games in user mode. :D

Until I wanted to be like those guy who knows everything about computing and electronic...

So I "Tried" software security. I was A good script kiddy... however atmospher was strange and I'm super fragile :D

Until I left to learn programming from scratch... no school exp... learning one thing after another drove me into a spiral... no kidding.

It was never enough... From frontend to backend in web to the same in operating system, hardware circuitry, datasheets and driver interface.

Meanwhile since 2000, I saw the web flipping on itself conway's way of life. It's a good experience but also a curse.

Telling it like this sounds like a wonderful story... It's not. life is not cool and quiet. I'm born in suburb from stupid copulation... my parent were stupid.

38 yo I'm still alive, smarter and dangerous? :D
