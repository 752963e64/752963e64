I'm self taught engineer in system and network programming with different languages,
operating systems since the 2000 era. Meanwhile I did website prototypes from the ground up,
with and without HTTP server from scratch. I also have a dusty stack pile from prototyping
devices modules(AntMiner U1*7,arduino,buspirate,armv7 RPi like) taking the dust. Few years ago I started
to have interest in game dev. So makes me a good generalist. I read binary/source code like books.
I'm not an AI and I don't use AI to generate content I share. I'm not that void...
I've no interest in AI; for me a program well done always fit any automation process.
To be clearer, There is no need a reasoning layer on top algorithm that are already reasoning.

### I'll try to say hello in a different way every night from hand.

"You've to hate things to move on the next one fiting the purpose. Only Aging let you understand this. Just don't be sarcastic."

```
$ cat m.c
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
  printf("%s, %s", "Hello", "World!" );
}
```

```
$ gcc -o m ./m.c && ./m && echo $?
```
